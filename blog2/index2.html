        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. 
            This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or 
            with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article 
            helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.</p>

        <h2>A "Hello world!" example</h2>
        <p>1. Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, 
            create a new text document called main.js, and save it.
        </p>
       
         <p>2. In your index.html file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing < /body > tag:</p>
         <div class="img">
            <img src="img-1.jpg" alt="" id="img-1">
        </div>
         <p>3. This is doing the same job as the < link > element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</p>

         <p>4. Add this code to the scripts/main.js file:</p>
         <div class="img">
            <img src="img-2.jpg" alt="" id="img-2">
         </div>
         

         <p>5. Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load index.html in your browser. You should see something like this:
         </p>
        <div class="img">
            <img src="img-3.jpg" alt="" id="img-3">
        </div>
     </div>
